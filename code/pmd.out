mksqlite Version 2.5 build: Unversioned directory, an interface from MATLAB to SQLite
(c) 2008-2017 by Martin Kortmann <mail@kortmann.de>
                 Andreas Martin  <andimartin@users.sourceforge.net>
based on SQLite Version 3.16.2 - http://www.sqlite.org
mksqlite utilizes:
 - DEELX perl compatible regex engine Version 1.3 (Sswater@gmail.com)
 - BLOSC/LZ4 1.3.0-rc3.dev compression algorithm (Francesc Alted / Yann Collett) 
 - MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm (RFC 1321) implementation by Alexander Peslyak
